# API and Context System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Router Context Issue**:
   - Problem: `useNavigate()` may be used only in the context of a `<Router>` component
   - Solution: Reorganized context providers to ensure `AuthProvider` is wrapped inside the Router component

2. **Context Dependencies Issue**:
   - Problem: `useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider` error when CartContextProvider tried to use AuthContext
   - Solution: Fixed provider order to ensure proper nesting with dependencies respected

3. **API Data Context Improvements**:
   - Problem: API calls were not being properly structured and axios calls were incorrect
   - Solution: Fixed generic `fetchData` function to use proper axios method calls

4. **Context Providers Organization**:
   - Problem: Context providers were not properly nested, causing React Router hooks to fail
   - Solution: Restructured the provider hierarchy with proper nesting and dependency order

## File Modifications

### 1. App.js
- Added imports for `AuthProvider`, `ApiDataProvider`, and `RootContextProvider`
- Moved `AuthProvider` inside the Router component
- Nested `ApiDataProvider` inside `AuthProvider` to respect the dependency
- Nested `RootContextProvider` inside `ApiDataProvider` to ensure all contexts have access to auth and API functions
- Made sure all routes are wrapped inside the proper context hierarchy

### 2. RootContext.js
- Removed `AuthProvider` from the provider chain
- Removed `ApiDataProvider` from the provider chain (moved to App.js)
- Fixed import for `ToggleContextProvider`
- Updated component comment to indicate where providers are now located

### 3. index.js
- Removed `RootContextProvider` wrapper from around `<App />`
- Simplified the component hierarchy to avoid dependency conflicts

### 4. AuthContext.js
- Removed direct dependency on `useNavigate`
- Updated logout function to use `window.location.href` for navigation
- Added `token` to auth state for better tracking of authentication status

### 5. ApiDataContext.js
- Fixed axios method calls in the `fetchData` function
- Updated API URL construction to use `API_BASE_URL`
- Made sure it can access the auth state through the proper context hierarchy

## Provider Dependency Chain

The proper dependency order is now:

```
<Router>
  <AuthProvider>
    <ApiDataProvider>
      <RootContextProvider>
        <CartContextProvider>
          <WishlistProvider>
            <CardListProvider>
              <PaginationProvider>
                <ToggleContextProvider>
                  {/* Application Components */}
                </ToggleContextProvider>
              </PaginationProvider>
            </CardListProvider>
          </WishlistProvider>
        </CartContextProvider>
      </RootContextProvider>
    </ApiDataProvider>
  </AuthProvider>
</Router>
```

## Testing Instructions

1. Check that login/logout functionality works correctly
2. Verify that navigation after logout directs to the login page
3. Confirm that API calls in customer and vendor dashboards function properly
4. Test profile page functionality to ensure data loading and editing works
5. Verify that cart functionality works properly now that CartContextProvider has access to AuthProvider

## Next Steps

1. Address remaining ESLint warnings for unused variables
2. Optimize API call caching for better performance
3. Consider implementing more robust error handling for network failures
4. Review file upload handling in product management forms

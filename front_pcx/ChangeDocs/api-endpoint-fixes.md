# API Endpoint Fixes

This document details the fixes implemented to handle non-existent or problematic API endpoints in the XcelleratePCX application.

## 1. Missing Featured Products Endpoint

### Issue
- The application was making requests to a non-existent endpoint: `/api/products/featured/`
- This resulted in 404 errors: `Not Found: /api/products/featured/`
- Due to insufficient error handling, these failures were causing unlimited retry requests

### Root Causes
- The featured products endpoint doesn't exist in the backend
- The error handling didn't properly catch and handle 404 errors
- Component retry logic didn't prevent retries on permanently failed endpoints (like 404s)
- Multiple components were independently fetching from the same endpoint
- Component remounting was causing the error state to be lost

### Solution Implemented
We implemented a comprehensive global registry solution to track failed endpoints across the entire application:

#### Global Failed Endpoints Registry
- Added a `window.__FAILED_ENDPOINTS` object to track 404 errors across component remounts and the entire application
- Created helper functions to register failed endpoints and check if an endpoint has failed permanently
- Ensured this registry persists across component re-renders and remounts

#### ApiDataContext.js
- Implemented the global `failedEndpointsRegistry` to track failed endpoints application-wide
- Enhanced the core `fetchData` function to check the registry before making any request
- Modified `fetchFeaturedProducts` to immediately use fallbacks if the endpoint has failed before
- Improved request tracking with more robust duplicate prevention

#### HomePage.js
- Integrated with the global failed endpoints registry
- Added a check at the start of the `useEffect` to skip requests to known failed endpoints
- Implemented permanent failure registration when 404 errors are encountered
- Ensured error states persist across component remounts

#### CardList.js
- Updated the `safeApiCall` helper function to work with the global registry
- Added endpoint path parameters to all API calls for better tracking
- Implemented pre-request checks against the registry to avoid calls to known failed endpoints
- Enhanced error handling to register failed endpoints in the global registry

## 2. Request Prevention for Missing Endpoints

To prevent unnecessary requests to non-existent endpoints:

1. **Application-Level Failed Endpoint Registry**
   - Created a global registry (`window.__FAILED_ENDPOINTS`) to track all failed endpoints
   - Share knowledge of failed endpoints across all components
   - Persist failure information across component remounts and page refreshes

2. **Pre-Request Validation**
   - Check if an endpoint has previously failed before attempting the request
   - Skip requests to endpoints known to return 404 errors
   - Log clear messages when requests are skipped

3. **Fallback Hierarchy**
   - Implement multi-level fallbacks for critical endpoints
   - First try the official endpoint
   - Fall back to alternative endpoints if the primary one fails
   - Use placeholder data as a last resort

4. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Register all 404 errors in the global registry
   - Distinguish between temporary and permanent failures
   - Provide graceful UI experiences when endpoints fail

## Testing the Fixes

To verify the fixes are working correctly:

1. Monitor the network tab in browser dev tools:
   - There should be only one request to `/api/products/featured/` that fails with 404
   - Subsequent page loads should not attempt to access this endpoint again
   - You should see fallback requests to `/api/products/` instead

2. Monitor the console:
   - You should see a clear warning when an endpoint is registered as failed
   - You should see logs indicating skipped requests to known failed endpoints
   - There should not be repeated error messages for the same endpoints

3. Check application behavior:
   - The homepage should load correctly despite missing endpoints
   - Featured products should display using fallback data
   - No infinite loading spinners should appear
   - Performance should be improved with fewer redundant API calls
